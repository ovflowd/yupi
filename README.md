## About

#### 1. What is Yupi?
Yupi is an OSP Habbo Emulator, not created for production usages. Only for Algorithm and Development usages. The proposal of this emulator is see how Sulake's Habbo Hotel works. Not for piracy or Earning money.

**I must remember that as this project is osp you can do what u want. If you do inapropriate usages of this project, is your responsibility.**

*US Law remembers: Cyber Piracy is crime!*	
*US Law remembers: Pedophilie is crime!*

#### 2. What Yupi is based on?
Butterfly Emulator, originally created by Martinmine. Actually Based in a Butterfly's Edition called Azure Emulator.

#### 3. Why this emulator will be better?
**The purpose of this emulator isn't create a production usage. And isn't intended to create a perfect or good emulator. All this code is pretended to be right coded.**
Remembering that the project consists in a parcially/fully rewrite of the Azure Emulator, consisting in Class, Namespace, Code Rewrite. That means that will be used a Top-Down Methodology and an Agile based development methodology. The classes will be diagnost, and "scanned", and will be fully/parcially rewrited, planning to normalize and create a dynamic and abstract code.

#### 4. Who Made this Emulator?
The Original Creator was Martinmine creator of Butterfly, this emulator is directly based on the "decompiled" code from Butterfly Emulator and not from his original source code. Also this Emulator is based on the Azure Emulator 1.0190 version. After that, the code was intensivelly rewrited. Now the Emulator is OSP, and every collaborator is welcome. Remembering that this emulator started by Private Purposes.

#### 5. For who is this Emulator?
For everyone that want to learn about how Habbo Hotel works. Also for privately and end-user usage, development usage. Not for commercial or production usage. Also remembering this emulator is not intended to be used for piracy.

#### 6. Can i use this Emulator normally?
If u want, but beware, it's planned to be A Complete Database Rewrite. The Database Tables, and Columns will change without any pre-warning. And will not be supported migrations or update scripts. The use of this project is in your risk. And no update support will be given.

#### 7. Can i use any Habbo Content Management System?
If works, yes. But is recommended only use an "static" client.html, with generic SSO Ticket, (javascript flag sso_ticket static, and static entry for users.auth_ticket in MySQL Database)

#### 8. Can i ask questions (creating issues)?
You can, but will not be given configuration help. Only Configuration Parameters usage. Remember this project is designed for developers. So, newbies or "noobs" in the area will not receive starter helps. Is fully recommended only report code bugs, in-game bugs, and database exceptions. Also pull requests for improvements, or issues for critics/ideas/suggestions.

#### 9. Can i earn money with that?
No, if you use this Emulator for a Private Habbo Hotel, you're using the MIT License at your risk. Remembering that this Emulator is under Sulakes Commercial and End-User (Consumer) License. You cannot earn money with it, in all type of money, Google Adsene, AdWords, Ads, VIP Cares, etc. You can receive a DMCA Act, and Judicial Proccess from Sulake.

#### 10. Is this project allowed by Sulake?
No, definitively no. If they want this down, they have all rights. And the project will be immediatelly stopped and cancelled. This project will only continue if Sulake Allows. (Remembering Fake DMCA is crime!)

#### 11. Which SWF i can use?
Any SWF, remember to use the Emulator Production SWF. Recommended a RC4 Patch for Crack the SWF. Or only RSA Patch.

4. Click Debug.
5. The Executable output Path is: YourYupiFolder\Build\Executables\Platform\Yupi.exe
6. The Configuration, Variables, Logs, Cache, Packets Folder is YourYupiFolder\Build\Variables\

#### 2. To Edit the Emulator
Is potential recommended use a fork of this repository and also still update in the commits. As said before, the intention is rewrited the emulator, so a lot of things can be changed. Please stay updated in the commits, and help us with pull requests. Please don't remove the original credits. If you do that, nothing happens, but you being "bad" with all the developers that helped to the development of this emulator.
